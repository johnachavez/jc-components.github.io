/*
 * compass has a really cool concept where you can pass an image filename and
 * it renders the image inline in the css as a data-uri. 
 *  * https://github.com/Compass/compass/blob/stable/core/lib/compass/core/sass_extensions/functions/inline_image.rb
 *
 * This is kind of hard to do with libsass - we would need to write an
 * extension.  Instead, we can use broccoli as a post-processor to replace the
 * image urls with the content.
 *  * https://github.com/filippovdaniil/broccoli-sass-image-vars
 *  * https://github.com/blesh/broccoli-sass-image-compiler
 *
 * I discovered this after I had already wasted hours, so I'm sticking with
 * inlining the images here. I don't know how to get a broccoli tree to process
 * after styles. Maybe need to use an addon hook?

 *
 * Data urls can be text, but IE only supports base64
 *  * http://caniuse.com/#feat=datauri
 * Apparently non-base64 is ok if we urlencode the tags.
